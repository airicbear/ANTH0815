#+TITLE: ANTH0815 In-class Notes

* Jan 19

** Language is structured

- Syntagmatically (forming the relationship between two or more sequential linguistic units)

- Paradignmatically (forming mutually exclusive choices in the same syntactic role)

** Syntagmatically

"Polly wants a cracker."

- "Polly" => Subject
- "wants" => Verb
- "a cracker" => Object

English, like more than 1/3 of the world's languages, is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).

** Other languages are not SVO

Fijian (VOS): "Auraiia o koko"

Literally: Saw you (I) "I saw you"

** Paradignmatic

(Ronald Macaulay) (likes) (The Lemon Twigs).

(He) (adores) (Tom Petty).

(Chomsky) (dislikes) (improv comedy).

(My pet hamster) (saw) (Paris in springtime).

** 5-Minute Linguist Chapter 2

- What's a polyglot? How many of you are polyglots?

- Linguists overlap with many different fields:

  + biology

  + philosophy

  + neuroscience

  + anthropology

** Too much emphasis on words?

- The case of tonality---how intonation (and other things) affect meaning.

- E.g., Yucatec Maya: miis (high) "broom" vs. miis (low) "cat."

  - Or intonation in English

- Language is a system of systems, in which words are just a part.

** Basic structures of language

1. Phonology

2. Morphology

3. Syntax

4. Semantics

5. Pragmatics

* Jan 24: Language Systems, Phonology

- Syntagmatic refers to "shared rules"

- Paradignmatic refers to "choice of words"

** Basic structures of language

1. Phonology

2. Morphology

3. Syntax

4. Semantics

5. Pragmatics

** The Building Blocks of Language Part 1: Phonology

- Phonology: Study of the sound system of language

- Phone/segment=actual speech sound produced by the vocal tract & perceived as a unique sound

- Phoneme is perceived sound that signals a /difference in meaning/ when contrasted with another phoneme

  + is a /mental/ construct

** Phones and Phonemes

- p vs. p^h (aspirated p)

- These are different /phones/

- But are they different phonomes in English?

  + Allophone - variation of a phoneme

- Compare with Korean:

  + p^{h}ul -> 'fire'

  + pul -> 'grass'

- E.g., spit <-> pit

  + The 'p' in pit is aspirated

  + Notice the 'p' and the aspirated 'p' share the same spelling

** Minimial Pairs

- How about b vs. p?

- minimal pair: made up of two forms (words, phrases, sentences), that differ in meaning, have one phonetic difference, but are the same in all other respects

** Distinctive Features

- A trait that distinguishes one phoneme from another

- For example: Pin vs. bin

  + - voice vs. + voice

* Jan 26: Language Systems, Morphology/Syntax

** The Building Blocks of Language Part 2: Morphology

- Morphology: Study of forms of words

  + The analysis of morphemes---the smallest meaningful or grammatical unit of a language

  + For example: /-s/ to make a word plural.
    /-s/ and "book" are morphemes---book+s

  + Bound morpheme---meaningful grammatical unit that can not occur alone (e.g., /-s/)

  + Free morpheme---meaningful grammatical unit that can occur alone (e.g., "book")

** Affixes

- a bound morpheme that can be added to a root

  + Examples---prefixes (affixes added to the beginning of a root)

    - e.g., inter-dental

  + Suffixes---affixes added to the end of a root

    - e.g., bring-ing

  + Infixes---affixes inserted into the root

    - e.g., BONTOC /um/='becoming'

      + fikas "strong"---> f-um-ikas "becoming strong"

** The Building Blocks of Language Part 3: Syntax

- Syntax: Study of the way in which sentences are constructed from smaller units called /constituents/; how sentences are related to each other

- 2 main constituents:

  1. Subject

  2. Predicate

** Phrase Structure Rules

- Phrase structure: rules showing grammatical relationships beteween phrasal categories

- E.g., "Mary ate the hamburger"

  + What are the elements of this sentence?

    + What is the role of the first word in the sentence?
      The 2nd?
      3rd & 4th?

- The verb is always the most important thing in syntax across all languages.

** Syntactic rules for "Mary ate the hamburger"

Let S = 'sentence'.
Let NP = 'noun phrase'.
Let VP = 'verb phrase'.
Let DET = 'determiner', e.g., /the/, /a/, /an/
Let N = 'noun'.
Let V = 'verb'.

- S->NP + VP

- NP->(DET) N

- VP->V + NP

* Jan 28: Language Systems, Syntax continued

** Last time: syntactic rules for "Mary ate the hamburger"

S -> {
    NP -> {
        DET("∅"),
        N("MARY")
    }
    VP -> {
        V("ATE")

        NP -> {
            DET("THE"),
            N("HAMBURGER")
        }
    }
}

** Try this

"Julien bakes."

S -> {
    NP -> {
        N("Julien")
    }
    VP -> {
        V("BAKES")
    }
}

"Julien bakes pies."

S -> {
    NP -> {
        N("Julien")
    }
    VP -> {
        V("BAKES")

        NP -> {
            N("PIES")
        }
    }
}

"Julien bakes pies in the lab."

S -> {
    NP -> {
        N("Julien")
    }
    VP -> {
        V("BAKES")

        NP -> {
            N("PIES")
        }

        PP -> {
            PREP("IN")

            NP -> {
                DET("THE"),
                N("LAB")
            }
        }
    }
}

** Grammaticality & Ambiguity

- When the word sequence conforms to the syntactic rules of a language

  + e.g., *Fish give

  + Fluent (competent) speakers can detect grammatically

- Ambiguity--when more than one meaning results from either (a) lexical choice or (b) arrangement of words

** Ambiguity: Why do these sentences have more than one meaning?

- Lexical: "Fish are really smart. They are always found in schools."

- Structural/Grammatical: "Polly saw the man with the binoculars"

* Jan 31: Semantics

** Last Time: Syntax

- Phrase structure rules

- Tree diagrams

- Nature of linguistic cognition

** The Building Blocks Language, part 4

Semantics: the study of meaning in language.

** Two major kinds of semantics

- Lexical Semantics--concerns the meaning of words

  + Lexicon--the mental dictionary each person has

- Structural Semantics--concerns the meaning of utterances larger than the single word

** Kinds of meaning

- Referential

  + describes the _referent_ of an utterance--the actual concrete item or concept to which a word refers

  + E.g., "Your dog is barking." vs. "A dog is a fine pet for a family."

  + Mermaids and unicorns--concepts vs. concrete existence

- Sense--the extended meaning of a word or phrase that clarifies the referent

  + "Ann's cool."

** But do all words have a referent?

- "He is the teacher of the class."

  + /He/, /teacher/, /class/--yes

  + /is/, /the/, /of/--no

  + *"He teacher class"

- Shifting referents--are referents that differ for each speaker and each sentence

  + e.g., pronouns

** Lexical Semantics: Hyponyms

- Words that constitute a subclass of a more general word

  + Tree; hyponyms--maple, birch, pine, etc.

  + Car: coupe, sedan, SUV, etc.

- These words share many of the same semantic components as the more general word

** BUT, compare

- "She is a real lady." vs. "She is a real woman."

- So meaning is slightly different, even if the semantic properties are the same.

  + Same denotation (referential meaning) but different connotation (affective or sense meaning)

* Feb 04

- Parts of the brain

* Feb 07

- Why Language Acquisition & not Language Learning?

** The case for language innateness

1. Behavior (language) appears before it is necessary for survival

2. Does not appear as response to environment

3. Neither a conscious decision nor result or formal education

4. Behavior appears in a predictable seequence

5. Behavior appears during a critical period; afterwards it will be difficult or impossible to learn

** Innateness, I

- Innateness hypothesis (e.g. Noam Chomsky, Eric Lenneberg)

  + Children have innate capacity to differentiate phonemes (sounds), identify words, & process grammar

  + Based on the idea of _Universal Grammar_

    - Series of basic linguistic features hard-wired in the brain

      + e.g. plural, non-plural, noun/verb

** Innateness, II

- Language Acquisition Device

  + Theoretically, an area of hardwiring in the brains of children that drives them to acquire language

- Critical period Hypothesis

  + Language Acquisition Device is on a timer

* Feb 09

- Language acquisition

** Several Hypotheses

- Imitation hypothesis

  + By interaction with adults

  + But, imitation only accounts for logical, but sometimes incorrect forms, like *goed isntead of went

  + Can't account for language acquisition in areas where data are incorrect or where children aren't spoken to

    + In other words, where there is a *poverty of stimulus*

- Reinforcement hypothesis--children learn language by positive reinforcement

  + Parents respond to truth-value of statement, e.g., "Doggie go outside?"

- Interactions (constructivist) hypothtesis

  + A combination of 1 & 2

** A Look at Stages of Language Acquisition

1. Cooing--all vowel sounds (ahhh, oooh)

2. Babbling--alternates consonants/vowels

   1. Note that babies recognize sound distinctions adults do not

3. Holophrases--one-word sentences

   1. E.g., "Cat!" for "There is the cat" or "I want to pet the cat"

4. Two-word stage

   1. Two words in a grammatical relationship

      1. agent-action---'Doggie run'

      2. action-object---'push ball'

      3. possessor-possession---'Mommy car'

5. Telegraphic speech

   1. An expansion of the two-word stage--"sit car now?"

* Feb 11

** Language Disorders

- The term "Language Disorder" (or developmental dysphasia) has been used to refer to "any disruption in the learning of a native language"

- Environmental factors

  + Housing circumstances

** Broca's & Wernicke's Aphasia

- Damage to left hemisphere can cause aphasia (language disorder resulting from injury or trauma)

- Broca's Aphasia: Problem with syntax and finding words

- Wernicke's Aphasia: Fluent, but with jargon & nonsense words

** Bilingualism: 2 Types

- Simultaneous bilingualism

  + When the child acquires two or more languages from birth

  + E.g. Quebec, Canada

    - Francophone & Anglophone

** Sequential Bilingualism

- When the person acquires another language after having begun to acquire a first language

  + E.g. India, where English is a lingua franca, but may only be acquired in schools

** Social Attitudes around bilingualism

- Attitudes around language are cultural

  + E.g. Swiss proudly speak German, French, Italian

  + U.S. history of isolationism and assimilation leads to monolingualism

    - 1929 series of studies suggest bilingualism lowers IQ

    - But recent studies (Hoff 2001) show bilinguals are more creative problem solvers

* Feb 16: Communication or Language

** Last Time

- Why do we talk?

  + Biological basis for language

  + Rapid acquisition of language by children

** Bee "language"

- Karl von Frisch "The 'Language' and Orientation of the Bees" 1956

** But is it language?
** Chracteristics of Communication:

- According to Hockett 1960: expanded from Napoli

  1. Mode of communication

  2. Semantic

  3. Pragmatic

** Some Communication Systems have

4. Interchangeability

5. Cultural Transmission

6. Arbitrariness

7. Discreteness

** Human Language alone appears to have

8. Displacement

* Feb 18

** Last Time

- Honeybees

- Language vs. communication

  + The importance of productivity and spatiotemporal displacement

** Linguistic Ideology
** What is Linguistic Ideology?

- Refers to the values associated with particular ways of speaking & writing

  + Cultural ideas of prestige, stigmatization are essential

  + Ideology is often unconscious--taken as "fact"

- Standard Language:

  + "a set of ideas about what constitutes the best form of a language, the form which everyone ought to imitate"

** Can one person's approach speech be better than another's?

- Prescriptivist vs. Descriptivist approaches to language

** Variety in Language
** Communication and Distinctive Speech

- Speech production and comprehension relies on minute changes in vocal apparatus

- tongue and vocal cords make rapid and minute variations of position & tension

- human ear is skillful in detecting slight variations in the sounds produced by the vocal tract

** Different ways to study variation in language:

- Sociolinguistics

  + the study of how language mirrors social factors (like ethnicity, age, gender, social class) are related

- Linguistic Anthropology

  + Socially patterned variation in linguistic performance

    - i.e. how do "culture" and "society" influence language?

* Feb 21 Dialects

** Last Time

- Language ideology

** Speech Community

- Speech Community

  + a group of people who live, work, socialize, and communicate with one another, using a dialect

    + /Dialect/: Shared, unique characteristics of a speech community

    + Dialects are often assumed to refer to syntax and lexicon, whereas accent refers  to phonological variation

** Speech Community, 2

- Dialects aren't something a few people possess (e.g. New Yorkers or Southerners)

- Everyone belongs to a speech community, so we all speak a dialect

- Some dialects do have greater prestige--Standard American English (SAE) or BBC English

** Dialects vs. Languages

- Distinction between language and dialect is not always clear

  + Mutual intelligibility

- All languages, except the original "proto-language," were dialects at one time

  + Example: French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian are descendants of the language spoken by the Romans, which was just a dialect of Latin

- See Chapter 12, page 61, diagram 12.1, for some of the social dimensions of dialects

** The role of geography

* Feb 25 African American Vernacular English

** Last Time

- Pidgin---case study of a dialect and of language ideology

** Overview

- History
- Phonology
- Syntax (Grammar)
- Lexicon
- Socio-cultural issues

* Mar 07 African American Vernacular English

** History

- African American Vernacular English (AAVE) a.k.a:

  + African American English (AAE)

  + Black English (Vernacular)

  + African American Language

  + Ebonics

- AAVE refers to a variety of dialects spoken primarily

** Problems with the labels "African American Language" & "Ebonics"

- Problem:

  + These terms can suggest different languages as opposed to dialects of English

** Dialectologist View

- 1920s-1940s--first scholarly analyses of AAVE

- AAVE thought to originate in the South, as a variety of southern English

- With migration out of the south, Black Americans carried AAVE into Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, New York, etc.

  + This migration accounts for similarities across regions

** Creolist View

- Challenges dialectologist view

- Traded AAVE back to West Africa, via the slave trade

- As Hausa, Wolof, Bulu, Twi etc. were forced together, a pidgin language emerged

- Eventually, the pidgin becomes a creole language

  + creole: a more developed pidgin that is the primary language of an entire speech community

- Increased contact between the creole and other forms of English resulted in decreolization and the beginning of AAVE

- Proof: AAVE's resemblance to other creoles (Gullah)

* Mar 09

** Linguistic description of AAVE (Lippi-Green, etc.)

- What are some linguistic features of AAVE that you read about?

** Syntax

- Absence of present tense copula---examples: is, are

  + SAE: He's a great guy.
    AAVE: He a great guy.

- Different tense/aspect markers

  + SAE: He is usually late.
    AAVE: He be late.

  + SAE: He's late (at the moment).
    AAVE: He late.

** Phonology

- Simplification of voiced consonant clusters

  + hand => /han/

- Interdental fricatives (e.g. /th/) becomes stops (/t/ or /d/)

  + that => /dat/

** Lexicon

- Associated (incorrectly) with the slang of teenagers/young adults

  + phat, bustin' out, tubular

  + Short-lived, like most slang

  + Regionally restricted

- Geographically wide-spread usages are interesting

  + kitchen (curly hair at the nape of one's neck)

* Mar 11 AAVE, 3

** Last Time

- Phonological, Syntactic, Lexical features of AAVE

** Future Research

- How does regional variation affect AAVE?

** A problem

- Difference between vernacular and mainstream can work against AAVE students in IQ and achievement tests

  + Also, AAVE students' performance can be harmed by teachers who interpret AAVE differences as laziness or intellectual deficit

** Possible Solutions

- Linguists lead dialect-awareness workshops

- Linguists develop exercises to improve bidialectal importance

** Dialect Readers

- Language production vs. language comprehension

- West African data

- Little test data, but the data are positive

  + E.g., The Bridge Program:

    #+begin_quote
    6.2 month gain in score per 4 months of instruction (only 1.6 month gain per 4 months using standard methods)
    #+end_quote

- Dialect readeres abandoned, for economic and social reasons

** Linguists and Policy Decisions

- Tried to clear up public misunderstanding of Ebonics in the Oakland School Board case

- Urban Minorities Reading Project

  - Attempt to improve literacy schools of African American, Latino, and white students

* Mar 14

** A quick review

- Language often thought of as an idealized system

- BUT language is expressed by individual speakers

- WHY do speakers of languages speak differently?

  1. Region/Geography (dialects)

  2. Social class

** Development of Stratification

- Neolithic (ca. 10,300 BP) farming villages were basically egalitarian societies, like the foraging societies that had preceded them

- About 5,000 BP: in Southwestern Asia, Egypt, the Indus Valley (India), China, Mesoamerica (Valley of Mexico), and the Andes (Peru), humans independently developed _social stratification_

  + A form of social organization in which people have unequal access to wealth, power, and prestige

- Allows for some members of society to do things other than produce food

** Complex Societies

- Societies with large populations, _surplus production_, an extensive division of labor, and _occupational specialization_

- Surplus production

  + The production of amounts of food that exceed the basic subsistence needs of the population

- Occupational Specialization

  + Specialization in various occupations (e.g., weaving or pot making) or in new social roles (e.g., king or priest) that are found in socially complex societies

** Class

- A ranked group within a hierarchically stratified society whose membership is defined primarily in terms of wealth, occupation, or other economic criteria

  + Owners/workers, upper-income/middle-income/lower-income

- Involves the exercise of _power_

  + The ability to influence others

  + Contextual (not everyone has the same amount of power all the time)

** TSA Chapter 14: Social Stratification

- Social class/upbringing is directly correlated to one's language ability

  + Differences in language between different social classes increase with age

    - Glasgow children from different social classes at age 10 speak more alike than Glasgow adults

    - Rise in parental income equals rise in SAT score

    - Teachers often underestimate a student's potential

** To Sum up Chapter 14 TSA:

- Speech continues to mark prejudice

  + Listeners often make judgments about the speaker's social status, job, education, race, personality, etc.

    - E.g., New England postvocalic /r/ sound is dropped

      + This doesn't make rhoticc more _or_ less correct

  + No one variety of language is more logical than another

* Mar 16 Register & Style

** Situational Dialects or Registers

- Register: styles of speech that are appropriate to the situation, the level of formality, and the person being spoken to

- Lexical choice is often an indicator of formality e.g.

  | French Origin | Anglo-Saxon Origin |
  |---------------+--------------------|
  | Perspire      | Sweat              |
  | Abandon       | Leave              |
  | Desire        | Want               |

** Morphology & Register

- SAE (Standard American English) often uses contractions to mark informality

  + e.g. You should have vs. you should've

** Pronoun & Verb Choices

- What's the difference between:

  + Como estás tu?

  + Como está usted?

- Informality vs. Formality

- Social status

** Syntax & Register

- Placement of prepositions

  + Compare: "To whom should I send it?" and "Who should I send it to?"

- Deletion of auxiliary verbs (and sometimes the pronoun):

  + "Are you going to class today?"

  + "You going to class today?"

  + "Going to class today?"

** Standard English(es)

- "Had you a good time last night?"

- "My clothes need washed"

- "Will I shut the door?"

- "Did you have a good time last night?"
  "My clothes need washing."
  "Shall I shut the door?"

** Slang

- Slang words

  + Words that are newly coined or that have never been fully accepted in formal speech

- Clipping: TV, phone, fridge

  + Can convey affect e.g. couch potato

  + Can mark membership in a group, daddy-o

    - E.g. cool cat (Harlem 1950's); Rad (California, 1980's)

* Mar 23 Dysphemism/Gender

** Last Time

- Register/Situational dialect

  + Formality and interlocutor status

- Slang: novel or informal language

  + Used to mark affect and as identity marker

** What is Cockney Rhyming Slang?

- Typically consists of two or three words

- The last lexical item rhymes with the word holding the intended meaning

- Often, in usage, the rhyme is often reduced to its first element.
  It then becomes very difficult for outsiders unacquainted with the slang to understand.

** Gender & Language

- What's the difference?

  + Sex: biological aspects of being male or female

  + Gender: learned complex of masculine or feminine behaviors as part of culture

** Gender in languages can be marked...

- Hebrew

  + Verbs are conjugated differently by males & females

    |         | Males       | Females       |
    |---------+-------------+---------------|
    | I write | /ani kotƐv/ | /ani kotƐvƐt/ |

    |              | Said to a female | Said to a male |
    |--------------+------------------+----------------|
    | you          | /at/             | /ata/          |
    | How are you? | /ma ∫lomex/      | /ma ∫lomxa/    |

** Gender in Carib

|       | Females   | Males    |
|-------+-----------+----------|
| rain  | /kuyu/    | /kunobu/ |
| canoe | /kuriala/ | /ukuni/  |

** Gender differences in English

- Men & women use the same lexicon and syntax

- AND use the same varieties of informal, polite, and indirect speech

- BUT differ in rate of use and circumstances use of polite or indirect forms

* Mar 30 Writing Systems

** Last Time

- Gender in language

  + gender vs. sex

  + gender linguistically marked

  + gender stylistically dependent

- /The Greatest Invention/

** Writing

Writing: a graphic representation of units of speech

- Writing systems are based on speech

- Humans have been speaking for longer than they have been writing

  + Endocranial casts from 2MYA suggest capacity for speech

  + Oldest writing system is about 5200 years old

- Speech is acquired. Writing is learned.

** Logographic

- Symbols stand for whole words or morphemes

- Logogram

  + written symbols that represent a concept or word without indicating pronunciation

** Chinese Writing

- Each logogram stands for a word or concept

- Some meanings are represented by a combination of symbols

** Syllabic Writing

** Rebus Principle

Exemplifies phonetization of symbols

Logographic symbols come to represent sounds

** What's a syllable?

- Each symbol represents one syllable

- Syllables have many shapes

  + CV (to)

  + CVC (dad)

  + CCVC (crash)

** Syllabic Writing Systems

- Japanese

  + 2 syllabic scripts: Katakana & Hiragana

  + 46 basic symbols in each that represent a consonant and vowel pair

** The trouble with graphemes

- Alphaebtic: symbols represent single phonemes

- 26 in English; 36 in Russian, 22 in Hebrew

  + Ideally, one grapheme per phoneme

  + r, v

  + But

    - /k/=kitchen, cook, exceed

* Apr 04 Writing

** Printing: Development & Importance

- Before 1455 (in the West) printing was slow, because it was done by hand

  + Library in Alexandria

- Printing press allows for mass production

- First presses were blocks of wood (China 868 CE)--called block printing

- Moveable type--China, 1041 CE, and Gutenberg, 1455 CE

- Spread of ideas, fueled Renaissance, Industrial Revolution

** Computers

- Decentralized

  + Unlike Alexandria, knowledge is widely disseminated

- Greater accessibility/greater manipulation

- Computers will not replace writing--Additive nature of human culture.
  But they will certainly change it, and how people relate to language.

** Historical Linguistics: Terms

- Synchronic: Language analyzed at one point in time

- Diachronic: Language analyzed over time

- Language Family: Group of languages derived from the same ancestral language

- Proto-Language--ancestral parent language assumed to be the source of many languages (and some language families)

  + unobserved

** Proto-Indo-European (PIE)

- Mother tongue of the modern Western European Languages, as well as Sanskrit, ancient Greek, and Latin--about 144 modern and extinct languages of Europe

- Why did PIE change?

  + Geographical Division

  + Lanugage Contact (borrowing)

  + Internal change (drift)

- Denisovans

** Two theories of language change

- Family Tree Theory

  + August Schleicher, 1871

  + Language change is regular and similarity is "genetic"

- Wave Theory

  + Johannes Schmidt, 1872

  + Gradual spread of language, like pebble in a pond

** Types of Language Change

* Apr 18 Linguistic Relativity

** Linguistic Relativity (or Sapir-Whorf) Hypothesis

** Language and Thought

- One view: Language simply reflects culture:

  + "to catch a train"

- But what about words that don't match reality?

  + Things=Nouns,Actions=verbs

    - Lightning--a "thing" that is closer to an action

** Language and Thought, 2

- English: I ate dinner with my neighbor yesterday

- Spanish: vecino (m)/vecina (f)

** Yucatec Maya

- English: Brother,Sister

- Yucatec:

  + Suku'un=older brother

  + Kiik=older sister

  + iitsin=younger sibling

** Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897-1941)

- Chemical engineer

- Worked for Hartford Fire Insurance Company

- Language and worldview extend beyond word association

- Student of Edward Sapir

** Benjamin Lee Whorf's Research

- Linguistic relativity: Whether and to what extent structures of specific languages have an impact on the thought or behavior of those who speak them.

- Method: Compare Standard Average European (SAE) to non-SAE languages

** SAE vs. Hopi: SAE TIME

- Time terms can take cardinal numbers and plural markers

  + E.g. "10 days" just like "10 marbles"

- Time is treated as a /count/ noun not a /mass/ noun

  + count: can form a plural; can be used with indefinite article in the singular

  + mass: can't be counted (form+'of'+substance)

* Apr 22 Linguistic Relativity

** Last Time

- How do language structures affect habitual thinking and behavior?

  + Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis

** Why does time talk matter?

- SAE Time:

  + Linear

  + Segmentable

  + Time is counted, histories are written, interest is compounded daily

- Hopi Time:

  + Unmanifest world becomes manifest

  + Wishes affect the material world

  + Hopis don't record history the way we do

** Whorf's Influence

- Immediately after Whorf's Hypothesis (1940s-1960s) there were efforts to prove/disprove hypothesis

- Effect of Chomsky

- Today: Middle ground

** Yucatec Numeral Classifiers

- p'eel=inanimate

- t'uul=animate

- p'iit=bit or piece
